# Sudoku-Solver
This project is a robust backtracking algorithm for Sudoku. It is capable of solving standard and larger-scale puzzles (e.g., 16x16). The solution correctly parses input files, enforces all Sudoku constraints, and outputs the result to both the console and a designated solution file along with performance metrics.
